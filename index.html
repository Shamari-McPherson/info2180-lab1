        <p>While i am not sure what to write, there is not much to say about myself. My journey at UWI started from watching flash during covid while i was still in highschool. Somehow between a television show and my love of physics l three years later I am now in my last year of a major in Electronics and Computer Science.
            In my final year i was asked to choose electives and i choose Web development has the topics thought here are intergral in the foundation needed to complete my capstone project.
